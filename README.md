# FCSWatch [![](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/fcswatch.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FcsWatch)
Run standard fsharp codes in watch mode

## MiniSample 
For a quick play around 
Try https://github.com/humhei/FcsWatchMiniSample 
    
## Get started

1. Install [fake5](https://fake.build/fake-gettingstarted.html)
2. Replace build.fsx with below codes
```fsharp
#r "paket:
nuget Atrous.Core.Utils
nuget Fake.Core.Target
nuget FcsWatch //"

#load "./.fake/build.fsx/intellisense.fsx"

// start build
open Fake.Core
open Fake.IO
open Microsoft.FSharp.Compiler.SourceCodeServices
open FcsWatch.FakeHelper
open Atrous.Core.Utils.FakeHelper

let root = Path.getDirectory "./"
Target.create "FcsWatch" (fun _ ->  
    let projectFile = Path.getFullName "YourProject/YourProject.fsproj"
    dotnet root "build" [projectFile]
    let checker = FSharpChecker.Create()
    /// or runFcsWatcherWith for more customizations
    runFcsWatcher checker projectFile
)

Target.create "Default" ignore

Target.runOrDefault "Default"
```
3. `fake build -t "FcsWatch"`
4. `Change fs files in YourProject` and save it



### Launch debugging in vscode
You can also launch debugging when running in watch mode 
```
    {
        "name": "launch TestProject",
        "type": "coreclr",
        "request": "launch",
        "preLaunchTask": "emitCompilerTmp",
        "program": "${workspaceFolder}/YourProject/bin/Debug/targetFramwork/YourProject.exe",
    },
    /// send a http request to copy dlls in obj to bin
    {
        "label": "emitCompilerTmp",
        "command": "curl",
        "args": [
            "--config",
            ".fake/fcswatch/port.cache"
        ],
        "presentation": {
            "reveal": "silent"
        }
    },
  },
```

When you are debugging files,watch mode still take effect




### Multiple reference projects
It is supported if you pass the entry project argument to it

### Release Notes 
more features: Please open Release_Notes detail

### Plugin mode
e.g.: excelDna sample
vscode launch.json setting
```
    {
      "name": "Attach Excel",
      "type": "clr",
      "request": "attach",
      "preLaunchTask": "emitCompilerTmp",
      "processId": 14876
    },
```

build.fsx setting
```fsharp
    /// trigger when file changed was detected 
    /// and (re)load debugger (after emit cache) 
    let installPlugin() =
        dotnet projectDir "msbuild" ["/t:ExcelDnaBuild;ExcelDnaPack"]
        addIn.Installed <- true
        Trace.trace "installed plugin"

    /// trigger when file changed was detected 
    /// and (re)load debugger (before emit cache) 
    let unInstall() =
        addIn.Installed <- false
        Trace.trace "unInstalled plugin"

    /// trigger when (re)load debugger (after installPlugin()) 
    let calculate() =
        Trace.trace "calculate worksheet"
        worksheet.Calculate()

    let plugin = 
        { Load = installPlugin 
          Unload = unInstall 
          Calculate = calculate
          /// Thread sleed to wait debugger attached.
          /// Trigger when file changed was not detected 
          /// and reload debugger 
          DebuggerAttachTimeDelay = 1000 }

    runFcsWatcherWith (fun config ->
        { config with 
            Logger = Logger.Normal
            DevelopmentTarget = DevelopmentTarget.Plugin plugin
        }
    ) checker projectFile
    
```

### Why?
why not use dotnet watch:
1. dotnet watch reference all dlls every time (which will take at least 3000ms?) (while fcs hold dlls in runtime cache)
2. not easy to debug when you are using dotnet watch
